      <p class="info">An eco-brick is a building block made entirely from un-recyclable plastic it's created by filling a plastic bottle with clean, dry plastic until it's packed tightly and can be used as a building block. It is one the most effective way of recycling plastic waste. To promote this idea, students of all grades were asked to prepare eco-bricks and deposit it at the school with their respective Science teachers. These were then collected to build varied structures around the school.</p>

      <h3 class="info-heading">Planting Trees</h3>
      <p class="info">The concept of Green -corner was initiated. A spot was chosen near the school basketball court to be decorated with a variety of plants and a wall was dedicated to grow potted plants.  Each class was provided with a plant to be nurtured. This ensured that students learn to nurture a plant as well as breathe fresh air.</p>

      <h3 class="info-heading">Beach Cleaning</h3>
      <p class="info">Waste and litter thrown around near water bodies are one of the major causes of water pollution. A school team consisting of students and teachers visited a nearby beach and did a cleaning drive by collecting the trash lying around on the beach. This was an initiative to reduce water pollution as well as a way of giving back to the society by indulging in volunteer service. </p>

    <div class="video-card">
    <h1 class="video-heading">Initiatives that go beyond the school walls</h1>
     <p class="video-p"> We believe in instilling the idea of saving nature and nurturing Mother Earth within our students in a way that they do not stop their efforts within the school premises.
To further implement this idea, students of grades 3 and 4 were encouraged to build their very own terrariums at home. This ensured that they put in efforts to bring in some fresh air within their homes too. They further prepared a video tutorial describing the method to build a terrarium with limited resources at home.
