      <h3 class="popup-heading">Reducing and Reusing Plastics </h3>
      <p class="popup-content">Frequent best-out-of-waste contests are conducted in across all classes to encourage the students to use the non-biodegradable waste in a productive and creative way. Their creations are also displayed to spread the message further. Students are asked to refrain from bringing plastic bottles, lunch boxes and instead bring metal bottles and lunch boxes to reduce the use of plastic within school premises.</p>

    <p class="info">An eco-brick is a building block made entirely from un-recyclable plastic it's created by filling a plastic bottle with clean, dry plastic until it's packed tightly and can be used as a building block. It is one the most effective way of recycling plastic waste. To promote this idea, students of all grades were asked to prepare eco-bricks and deposit it at the school with their respective Science teachers. These were then collected to build varied structures around the school.</p>

<p class="info">
  The concept of Green -corner was initiated. A spot was chosen near the school basketball court to be decorated with a variety of plants and a wall was dedicated to grow potted plants.  Each class was provided with a plant to be nurtured. This ensured that students learn to nurture a plant as well as breathe fresh air.As part of the Eco â€“ Club initiative saplings were planted around the school. The students enjoyed learning about the steps to plant a tree and the nourishment to be provided for it to grow well.</p>

  <p class="info">
    Waste and litter thrown around near water bodies are one of the major causes of water pollution. A school team consisting of students and teachers visited a nearby beach and did a cleaning drive by collecting the trash lying around on the beach. This was an initiative to reduce water pollution as well as a way of giving back to the society by indulging in volunteer service. </p>

    <h1 class="video-heading">Initiatives that go beyond the school walls</h1>
    <p class="video-p">We believe in instilling the idea of saving nature and nurturing Mother Earth within our students in a way that they do not stop their efforts within the school premises.
      To further implement this idea, students of grades 3 and 4 were encouraged to build their very own terrariums at home. This ensured that they put in efforts to bring in some fresh air within their homes too. They further prepared a video tutorial describing the method to build a terrarium with limited resources at home.
