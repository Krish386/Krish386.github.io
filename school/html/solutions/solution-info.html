      <p class="info">
        We encourage all children to plant as many trees as possible, not just in school, but at home as well. Through activities such as providing each child with a plant, we imprint the values of nurturing a plant, through which they will not only improve the air quality in their homes, but will also learn how they can plant and nurture a plant on their own.</p>
